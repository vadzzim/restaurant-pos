# Build log

Significant issues only: what broke, the root cause, and the fix. One short paragraph each.
Trivial typos are not recorded.

## M0 — scaffolding

Nothing broke. No code yet.

## M1 — monorepo and infrastructure

The registry's current TypeScript 7 release exceeded `typescript-eslint`'s supported peer range,
so the workspace was pinned to the current TypeScript 6 release. TypeScript 6 also deprecated
`baseUrl`; path aliases now use explicit relative targets and need no compatibility suppression.

Review caught that the optional Compose app profile relied on locally prebuilt shared packages,
used a localhost API proxy inside the web container, required an ignored `.env`, and could not
report Console as healthy. The profile now installs with a container-safe layout, builds shared
packages, uses a service-aware proxy, treats `.env` as optional, and checks Console's `/health`.

Redpanda started successfully but stayed unhealthy because `rpk cluster health` in the pinned
image no longer accepts `--brokers`. The healthcheck now uses the supported
`--exit-when-healthy` flag; a direct `rpk cluster info` confirmed the broker itself was running.

## M2 — schema, migrations, seed

Nothing broke at the database level: the generated migration applied to the clean database on the
first attempt, and the seed was idempotent from the start.

Two small friction points. Drizzle's `db.execute<T>` constrains `T` to `Record<string, unknown>`,
so the row shapes in `db:check` are intersection types rather than plain interfaces — an interface
has no index signature and is rejected. And Prettier tried to reformat the generated
`drizzle/meta/*.json` snapshots, which would put the repository permanently at odds with
`drizzle-kit generate`; `apps/api/drizzle/` is now in `.prettierignore`.

## M3 — vertical slice, backend

**The path aliases from M1 had to go.** `tsconfig.base.json` mapped `@pos/*` to package _sources_.
As soon as one package imported another (`@pos/domain` needs `@pos/contracts`), `tsc` pulled the
dependency's source into the dependent's program and failed on `rootDir`, after quietly emitting
`index.js` and `index.d.ts` next to `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`. Resolution now goes through
each package's `exports` field to `dist`, which is what the workspace already built before every
command. Test suites alias the sources explicitly in their own Vitest config, so a stale `dist`
cannot hide a broken change while developing.

**`Db` could not be inferred.** `type Db = ReturnType<typeof createDb>['db']` is circular once
`createDb` returns an object typed with `Db`. It is now `NodePgDatabase<typeof schema>`, stated
outright.

**Raw rows carry text timestamps.** Drizzle installs its own `pg` type parsers, so `created_at`
from `tx.execute` is a string, not a `Date`. The publisher wraps it in `new Date(...)`; the typed
query builder is unaffected.

**Root `pnpm test` raced against itself.** The api and worker suites share one `pos_test` database
and truncate the same tables, and pnpm runs workspace scripts in parallel by default. The root
script now passes `--workspace-concurrency=1`.

**A concurrent retry answered CONFLICT.** Two copies of the _same_ mutation in flight: the loser's
versioned UPDATE matched zero rows, so it returned `409 CONFLICT` even though its own effect had
just been applied by the winner. A client would have halted its queue over its own retry (§14.1).
The conflict path now looks the `mutationId` up after the rollback and answers `ALREADY_APPLIED`
when the winner's row is there. Caught by a test written for exactly that race.
