# Build log

Significant issues only: what broke, the root cause, and the fix. One short paragraph each.
Trivial typos are not recorded.

## M0 — scaffolding

Nothing broke. No code yet.

## M1 — monorepo and infrastructure

The registry's current TypeScript 7 release exceeded `typescript-eslint`'s supported peer range,
so the workspace was pinned to the current TypeScript 6 release. TypeScript 6 also deprecated
`baseUrl`; path aliases now use explicit relative targets and need no compatibility suppression.

Review caught that the optional Compose app profile relied on locally prebuilt shared packages,
used a localhost API proxy inside the web container, required an ignored `.env`, and could not
report Console as healthy. The profile now installs with a container-safe layout, builds shared
packages, uses a service-aware proxy, treats `.env` as optional, and checks Console's `/health`.

Redpanda started successfully but stayed unhealthy because `rpk cluster health` in the pinned
image no longer accepts `--brokers`. The healthcheck now uses the supported
`--exit-when-healthy` flag; a direct `rpk cluster info` confirmed the broker itself was running.

## M2 — schema, migrations, seed

Nothing broke at the database level: the generated migration applied to the clean database on the
first attempt, and the seed was idempotent from the start.

Two small friction points. Drizzle's `db.execute<T>` constrains `T` to `Record<string, unknown>`,
so the row shapes in `db:check` are intersection types rather than plain interfaces — an interface
has no index signature and is rejected. And Prettier tried to reformat the generated
`drizzle/meta/*.json` snapshots, which would put the repository permanently at odds with
`drizzle-kit generate`; `apps/api/drizzle/` is now in `.prettierignore`.
